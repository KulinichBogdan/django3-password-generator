    <h1>About the project</h1>

    <p>This is the first project in my attempt to learn the basics of the Django web programming.
        My final aim is to develop some skills in developoming web pages to apply them in 
        creating different mapping applications. 
    </p>
    <p>This current password generator is not related in any way to the field of GIS, which is 
        mostly about spatial data but it is an small step towards that future objective.
    </p>
    <p>In any case, enjoy the project and generate beautiful random passwords!</p>
